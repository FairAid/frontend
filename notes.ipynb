    "\n",
    "The shared key generated through key derivation functions (like the one in your code) is typically used in symmetric encryption algorithms (e.g., AES). Symmetric encryption means the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data.\n",

    "The primary purpose of the shared key in cryptographic protocols like Elliptic-Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) is to establish a secure communication channel between two parties. If the shared key is exposed, any encrypted communication using that key can be intercepted and decrypted by unauthorized parties.\n",
