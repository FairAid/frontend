    "* Think about implementation: when updating an ID an admin can set a new password and encrypt edited data with this password. So, the user will not be able to decrypt the data inside their account. We need to somehow check that an admin cannot edit an ID without a user's permission and cannot set an arbitrary password. One of the ways to do that would be to verify that the password that was initially used to encrypt the data when issuing the ID is the same as the one used when updating the metadata. However, this would include storing a user's password in some way. Perhaps, we could store the hashed password inside the json file with metadata. Then when entering the password to edit the ID we would hash the password again and compare to the one that is posted inside the existing json file. However, is it safe to store a password on IPFS even if it is hashed? This would also allow to change the password when editing the ID. However, if one would forget their password it would still be impossible to restore the password or create a new one. So, the user would need to first burn the existing ID and issue a new one. It means there's no password recovery. Another way to solve this would be to store an email address (hashed or unhashed) inside the IPFS file. Then generate a random 6-digit number and send to the email address before editing an ID. The 6-digit number wouldn't be displayed to an admin. Once a user receives the 6-digit number, it is passed as an input and compared to the one generated inside the app. If the 6-digit number matches, then an admin can edit the ID. This approach also allows to change the password for encryption/decryption for the user if they lost it. There may exist libraries for implementing this functionality. Need to check. \n",
